# 👋 Hi, I'm Isaiah Holder  
### **Full-Stack Developer — WordPress • React • Java (Spring Boot)**  
I build **fast, scalable, modern applications** that solve real business problems.  
Clean architecture, performance engineering, and practical problem-solving are at the center of everything I do.

## 🚀 What I Do
### **WordPress Engineering**
- Custom themes & plugins  
- 90+ Lighthouse performance optimization  
- WooCommerce enhancements  
- API integrations & headless CMS builds  

### **React Front-End Development**
- Component-driven UI  
- Dashboards & internal tools  
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)  
- API-driven front ends & responsive UX  

### **Java Backend Development (Spring Boot)**
- REST API design  
- Authentication (JWT / OAuth)  
- Microservices & modular architectures  
- CI/CD, testing & system reliability  

---

## 🧱 My Engineering Approach
I believe in writing code that is:
- **Clean** (readable, scalable, maintainable)  
- **Performant** (fast load times, optimized APIs)  
- **Reliable** (tests, error handling, stable deployments)  
- **Business-focused** (built for ROI, not complexity)  

I take pride in solving the underlying problem — not just writing code around symptoms.
